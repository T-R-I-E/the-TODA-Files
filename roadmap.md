The TODA Research Institute, better known as TRIE, is driving the initiative to bring TODA to the world. With the support of companies in the ecosystem like TODAQ and TODA.Network, as well as a broad array of industry groups, academic partners, and developers, we are honoured to undertake this work, thrilled to be bringing TODA to the world, and determined to see it through.

Getting to this point has required a tremendous amount of effort, and there's a ton of work queued up ahead of us. Come join us, this is going to be fun.
